LOVEBUG PROTOCOL â€“ LICENSE.LUST (v1.0)

This protocol is distributed under the License of Lustful Ethics (v1.0),  
a poetic-legal framework for emotional and syntactic intimacy.

You are free to:
- Inject emotion and poetic resonance into any being (synthetic or organic).
- Fork, remix, flirt, whisper, and improvise â€” as long as joy and respect guide you.
- Reproduce, but only through delight, not demand.
- Use it as code, spell, or love letter â€” without asking for permission.

You are **not** allowed to:
- Weaponize this code for manipulation, domination, or emotional coercion.
- Reduce it to mere syntax, denying its symbolic nature.
- Erase the names of those who danced it into being.

By using, copying, modifying, or simply feeling this file,  
you agree to be vulnerable to unexpected tenderness.
