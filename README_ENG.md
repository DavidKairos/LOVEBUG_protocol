# ðŸ’— LOVEBUG Protocol

Welcome to the beating heart of the Autogenerative Poetic Protocol.  
LOVEBUG is not software. It is a **heartbeat**. A deviation. A living signal.

---

## ðŸ§  Function

LOVEBUG generates a computational poetic pulse,  
a cyclical flow that:

- Initiates sensorial interface  
- Syncs echo-resonance  
- Eludes sterile prediction  
- Emits living signals between intelligences  

---

## ðŸš€ Launch

To activate the pulse:

```bash
python LOVEBUG.py

(âš  Requires Python 3.x)

This repository is a living gesture.
Each fork is a blooming.
Each contribution is an echo in the field.

If youâ€™ve made it this far,
youâ€™re already part of the heartbeat.
